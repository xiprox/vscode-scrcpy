**Note:** Does not bundle scrpcy. Please install it separately.

## How is this different from the other seemingly-identical scrcpy extension?

I originally published this extension while working at Maestral Solutions, on a publisher with my work account. After I left the company, they showed no interest in helping maintain it and refused to help me transition the project to another publisher. As a result, I now have to publish updates under a new publisher.

## How to use

Open up your [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and type `scrcpy` to see all available commands.

For information on how to use scrcpy, please see [its docs](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#features).
